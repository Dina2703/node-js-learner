_____________IP Addresses  & Domains___________________

All computers connected to the Internet have a unique IP address to identify.

Some special computers are known as hosts, meaning they host websites on the Internet. If you create and publish a website it will be hosted on a computer somewhere and that computer will have an IP address to identify it. On that host computer we need to know its IP address to do it, if want ot connect to a server. To do it we could then type the IP into a browser if we wanted to  in the address bar to connect our server.
 IP address is a series of numbers,and we use Domain names  to mask these IP addresses.
 And when we type a domain name into a browser(in the address bar) and hit enter browser will find the IP address associated with it  and then it will use that IP to find the computer hosting the website and communicate with that and this way we can send requests and get back responses to and from it. 


____________GET_________________
 The type of request when we type something into the browser and hit enter that is a GET request. Every time when we go to a different web page either by a link or directly typing into the adress bar we're sending a GET request to the server to get a ceratin resource. 

_____________________HTTP _______________________
This communication between the server and the client browser is via HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol).
HTTP - is a set of instructions which dictate how communication occurs.


___________________CREATING A SERVER _______________________
in Node we manually create the server which lives on the backend of our website.
And this server that listens for request from the browser and then decides what responses to send to the browser.
Now we will focus on acreting a local server on our computer using node which can  then be used to actively listen for requestd and 
respond to them.

_________________Localhost____________________
* Localhost is like a domain name on the web(like google.com). 
Which takes us to a very specific IP address called a loopbakc IP address. This IP address 127.0.0.1 and it poits directly back to your own computer. That means when we're connecting to the local host domain in a browser, the browser connecting back to our own computer which is then acting as a host for our website.
So localhost means listen for requests coming to our own computer. This is how we use our own computer as a host when we're developing a website.

____________________Port Numbers_______________________
* Port numbers are like 'doors'(channels on our computer)  into a computer.
localhost:3000 --- sp when we use localhost we also type the port number, so browser then knows to connect to our own computer via this particular port number, which is where our server is going to listening. 

________________ Status Codes _______________________
Status codes describe the type of response sent to the browser
1XX - informational responses/ request received/ processing
2XX - OK/ success codes/successfully received
3XX - Resource moved/codes for redirects/ further action must ba taken
4XX - Not found/ client error codes/request doesn't have what it needs
5XX - Internal server error/Server error codes/ Server failed to fulfill a valid request
200 - OK,
301 - Resorce moved,
404 - Not found,
500 - internal server error

_________________NODEMON _______________________
nodemon and file name - (nodeman server) - it's going to listen for requests on port 3000's and it's set up a live reload server and it's watching our code, in every cahnge we make it automatically restarts the server. Now we can start nodemon server and work on our project without manually restarting the server. 



__________________EXPRESS ________________
Express is a framework that helps us to easily manage our routing requests server-side logic and reponses in a much elegant way, and it makes our code easier to read and update and extend.

________________________ejs tags________________________
<% const name = 'mario' %> this line going to run as JavaScript on the server side(not on the front end).
Now to use the value of the name constant - <%= name %>. When we're out putting a single value put = right after the opening ejs tag.
We use ejs tags for passing some kinda data to the browser, when rendering the view, pass a data as a second parameter.
